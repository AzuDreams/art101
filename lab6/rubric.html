			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged me to learn about arrays and object in javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wanted to make an animation for the script section of my text. I was having trouble as my css was not affecting the text in the script tag
						however, after testing a bit I figured out that I had to add tags within the document.writeln string. I also had some trouble figuring out how to do the
						animation I wanted for my script text but with after my lab partner helped me understand the css from the stackoverflow page I was referencing I got it
						working how I wanted it to.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Coming from a cs background a lot of the js coding parts of this class are fairly simple so I've been trying to challenge myself to learn
						something new about css each lab. This time I learned about formating html with document.writeln so I can change it with css and I learned more about css animations.</p>
